### Nested classes
A nested class is a **class that is defined within the definition of another class**. We have to consider nested classes as yet another attribute. Like every class, it will have its own constructor, destructor, and attributes. And if you wonder about its relationship with inheritance, the truth is that there are no similarities. A nested class does not inherit from the class in which it is defined. **It will only act as one more attribute**, so we could define specific methods to treat them.
