# 42_CPP_Piscine
This is a C ++ Piscine designed to gain mastery with this amazing programming language. This C++ Piscine will be very important to understand and develop new skills
related to the world of Object Oriented Programming, inheritance, polymorphism and many other things that I will try to cover in this README. However, do not forget
that these notes are just a little information about everything that you will have to study if you want to do a good project. In the end, this is just an attempt to
provide you with a learning path during the development of your project, but at no point do I present it as the only source of information to be consulted. :)<br>
